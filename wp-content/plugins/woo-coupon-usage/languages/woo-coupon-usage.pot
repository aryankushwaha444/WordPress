"Coupon Affiliates enhances affiliate marketing by integrating coupons as a "

"referral links, this plugin allows affiliates to share their unique coupon "
"codes. These codes not only track sales for commission purposes but also "
"offer customers immediate discounts or special offers, enriching the "
"purchasing experience. However, the Coupon Affiliates system still maintains "
"the flexibility of referral links; affiliates can share URLs that "
"automatically apply their coupon at checkout, and even if a coupon isn't "
"used, you can <a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">still make the link alone "
"track referrals</a>, ensuring affiliates receive credit for every sale "
